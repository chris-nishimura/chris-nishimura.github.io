UI, or User Interface, is a very important part of any website or program in general. A good UI can make the difference between someone telling their friend about you website or them just exiting as soon as they see it. A good UI is not only functional but also pleasing to look at. Working with Semantic UI has helped us to work on the latter of those 2 things. There are many benefits to using Semantic UI, but first I will discuss a few disadvantages.

### Disadvantages
The biggest disadvantage to using Semantic UI is learning all the syntax that comes wth using it. Learning to use Semantic UI is almost like learning a new coding language. It uses a lot of things that are similar to HTML but it has it's own classes that can be difficult to remember.

### Advantages
There are many advantages to using Semantic UI. One of the advantages is that it makes it very simple to change aspects of a webpage. Once you start to get the hang of the syntax and classes it makes creating pleasing webpages very easy. Another advantage is that the classes are usually straight forward. If you want something to the right chances are you can just add right to the class.

### Conclusion
Overall Semantic UI is a very useful too for creating UI. It can help you to make nice looking web pages with very straight forward classes and functionality. I will continue to further my competance with Semantc UI and making UI in gernal.
