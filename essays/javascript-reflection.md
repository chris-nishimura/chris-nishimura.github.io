So far throughout my college career, I have learned several different programming languages. I have coded in Java, C, and now Javascript. There are many advantages and disavantages to each language. The first time I ever coded I used Java in my AP computer Science class. It was a good introduction to coding and since you have so specify varible types it helps you to learn what the different variable types are. The next language I learned was C in my ICS 212 class. C was a bit harder to grasp compared to java but had enough similarties to make the transition smooth. 
### JavaScript
Learning Javascript comparatively to the other 2 languages has been very easy. The syntax is similar enough and the fact that you don't need to specify variable types makes it a lot easier to code. So far I am really enjoying coding in Javascript and I think it may be my favorite language so far.
### Athletic software engineering
The athletic software engineering is a very different approach that cvaught me off guard at first. I didn't know what to expect from it, but so far it is going really well. I have a feeling that I won't be able to get through the whole semeter without DNFing, but so far I have been doing reletively well. I also feel like, even though the semeter has just started, it has already made me a more confident coder.
