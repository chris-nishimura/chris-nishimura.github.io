### Overview
Stem students usually have to use a program called pearson to do their math homework and it is not always the most intuitive thing to use for complicated problems.
## Problem
Pearson is ambiguous about how to format answers for certain problems, leading to getting a problem wrong despite having the correct answer.
## Solution
Create an app where users can work in an environment similar to Pearson so that their answer will be formatted correctly and they can just copy paste to Pearson.
## Approach
We will use math libraries (eg. mathquill) to help display the math correctly. We would make a wo column system with one side being the side that you work on and the other side having the problem that you are currently working on. When they are done with the current problem they can press enter and it will automatically format the answer to used in Pearson. There will also be multiple pages for different types of math problems (eg. integrals, derivatives, etc).
