I have been interested in software engineering ever since the first time I built my first computer when I was 13. Going through the whole process of finding the right parts and putting it together sparked my interest in computers. That coupled with my love for video games led me to take ap computer science when I was in high school. After finishing that class I went off to college and decided to major in computer science. Now that I am a few years into my major I am very excited to learn new skill about software engineering by taking this course.

I hope that by taking this course I will become more proficient in creatively coming up to solutions for various problems. I think that the wods in particular will be very helpful in getting me to become more proficient in thinking on the fly and solving problems. I also hope to learn how to be a more proficient coder and gain a better understanding of more languages.
