For my final project in ICS 314 we had to develop a web app in a group. You can view our app <a href="http://uhclubr.meteorapp.com/#/">here.</a> For this project I worked with 3 other people. They were Tysen Imai-Toyama, Sophia Kim, and Andrea Narcisco. Our app was a directory for clubs at UH. This is what the landing page looks like
