summary: I Helped to design a web app for a group final project in ICS 314.

For my final project in ICS 314 we had to develop a web app in a group. You can view our app <a href="http://uhclubr.meteorapp.com/#/">here.</a> For this project I worked with 3 other people. They were Tysen Imai-Toyama, Sophia Kim, and Andrea Narcisco. Our app was a directory for clubs at UH. This is what the landing page looks like,

The app had a list of the different clubs at UH with different tags that you could filter the clubs with. The club list looked like this,

### My Contributions
For this project I worked on the UI and general look of the sight. I was responsible for the CSS and formatting the various pages. I made sure all the fonts were consistent and that they looked nice. I also made sure the colors matched and that the words were easy to read.
### Conclusion
Overall this project was a very good experience and I enjoyed is very much. It helped me to become more proficient with my web design skills and to develop a few new ones.
