summary: I built an Imu for my Hawaiian culture project in high school.
---

I went to Kamehameha for High school and everyone had to take a Hawaiian culture class. For the class we had to do a final project by the end of the semester, for mine I decided to build an imu. If you don't know waht an imu is, it is a tradtional Hawaiian oven that is in the ground. Basically you make it by digging a hole and filling it with stones that will get hot when yoou start a fire inside. Then you put yur food inside and cover it with banana leaves. Doing this project helped me to learn how to organize people to do specific tasks, since I needed help to build it. I also gained respect for the hard work Hawaiians had to do to make an imu.
