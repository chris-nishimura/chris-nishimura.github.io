summary: I organized a blood drive for my final project in Personal Health class in high school.
---

When I was taking personal health in high school everyone had to do a final project that was some kind of community service or event that helped the community. For my final project I decided to organize a blood drive at the Blood Bank on young street. For this project I had to advertize the event and I asked several people to donate blood. I also came up with the time and decided to have it at the young street location. This project helped me to learn how to organize a community event.
